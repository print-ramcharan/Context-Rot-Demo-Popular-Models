# Mars Colony Life Support System (MCLSS) - Technical Specification v1.0

## 1. Overview
The MCLSS is a closed-loop biological and mechanical system designed to support a crew of 20 on the Martian surface for a duration of 500 sols.

## 2. Atmospheric Management Subsystem (AMS)
### 2.1 Oxygen Generation
- **Primary Source**: Electrolysis of harvested perchlorate brine.
- **Secondary Source**: Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cells (SOEC) processing Martian CO2.
- **Generation Rate**: 1.2 kg O2 per crew member per sol.
- **Storage Pressure**: 350 bar in high-tensile carbon fiber tanks located in Sector 4.

### 2.2 CO2 Removal
- **Primary Method**: Regenerative Amine Scrubbers.
- **Efficiency**: 98.4% removal of metabolic CO2 at partial pressures above 5 mmHg.
- **Maintenance**: Scrubbers require thermal regeneration every 8 hours.

## 3. Water Recovery Subsystem (WRS)
### 3.1 Treatment Modules
- **Module A (The Sentinel)**: Multi-stage filtration using activated charcoal and ion exchange resins.
- **Module B (Resonance-01)**: Vapor Compression Distillation (VCD) for urine processing.
- **Recovery Rate**: Targeting 95% total water recovery.

### 3.2 Storage
- **Main Reservoir**: 50,000 liter subterranean tank in Sector B-2.
- **Emergency Reserve**: 5,000 liters in the Habitation Hub (Hub-Alpha).

## 4. Power Infrastructure (PI)
### 4.1 Nuclear Kilopower
- **Output**: Four 10 kW Stirling engines (KRG-40).
- **Placement**: Located 200 meters north of the Habitation Hub.
- **Shielding**: 2-meter thick regolith overburden.

### 4.2 Solar Arrays
- **Type**: Gallium Arsenide triple-junction cells.
- **Capacity**: 150 kW peak at 1 AU; reduced to 45% during peak dust season.

## 5. Emergency Protocols
### 5.1 Pressure Loss (Code Red)
In the event of a breach exceeding 1.5 cm diameter, the Habitation Hub will auto-seal into four independent pressure containment zones (Alpha through Delta).

### 5.2 Power Failure (Code Black)
- **Priority 1**: Life support active sensors.
- **Priority 2**: Critical heating in Hub-Alpha.
- **Priority 3**: WRS Module A.
- **Disabled**: Non-essential lighting, research labs, and WRS Module B.

## 6. Crew Health and Nutrition
- **Hydroponics**: 200 m2 growth area for high-calorie crops (Potatoes, Quinoa, Spirulina).
- **Nutrient Mix**: Formula NX-72 administered via hydroponic irrigation system J-22.
